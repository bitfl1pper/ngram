# ngram

ngram library for clojure. This is intended to be a standalone library for now. I'd like to eventually incorporate it into a larger suite of text / sequence analysis software.

Very basic ngram stuff is implemented already.

very very basic skip gram functionality.

the next step is to revamp the tokenizer (and add more types of tokenizers)

After that, I'd like to generalize / improve the ngram functions, reduce redundancy

## Usage

I've just been using the REPL.

Hopefully, I'll get to a point where this software warrants some usage help.
