# ngram

ngram library for clojure. This is intended to be a standalone library for now. I'd like to eventually incorporate it into a larger suite of text / sequence analysis software.

Very basic ngram stuff is implemented already.

The next step in the roadmap is to implement skip-gram functionality.

## Usage

I've just been using the REPL.

Hopefully, I'll get to a point where this software warrants some usage help.
